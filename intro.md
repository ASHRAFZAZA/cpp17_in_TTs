Descriptions of C++17 features, presented mostly in "Tony Tables" (hey, the tables were my idea, but their name wasn't :-).

There are actually **over 100 changes in C++17**, only some of them are listed here.

Caveat1: *C++17 is completed, but not signed off yet.* There may still be changes, although _highly_ unlikely (modulo defects).  
Caveat2: *I make mistakes.*  This is more likely :-)

Created with the support from my employer, [Christie Digital Systems](https://www.christiedigital.com/en-us/business/solutions/projection-mapping).
